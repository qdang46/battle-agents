/**
 * `POST /api/bounties/[id]/fund` — the Next.js adapter.
 *
 * The path is rebuilt from the route segment rather than read off `request.url`,
 * for the reason the claim adapter gives: the segment is the one Next.js has
 * already matched, and re-parsing it would decide a question the router has an
 * answer to. The `encodeURIComponent`/`decodeURIComponent` pair is a round trip,
 * so the handler sees exactly the id Next.js put in `params`.
 *
 * Everything else is in `bounty-routes.ts`. The sponsor is not named here, and
 * that is the reason this route exists at all: whoever is calling is the sponsor,
 * and neither the segment nor the body gets a say.
